            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m Callum. I like to consider myself a hardworking, honest, and notably curious person. Since I first took apart my computer and made the Python shell play noughts and crosses with me, I’ve been fascinated by technology and software. Learning to code, problem solve and understand computer systems motivates itself for me. In my life, I have not encountered anything as satisfying and rewarding as working on problems and slowly but surely seeing the finished product form through hard work, creativity, and consistency, all the while learning during the process.</p>
            <p>Studying A-Level computer science and working on personal projects has significantly improved my understanding of data structures and algorithms. This website, along with other projects, has improved my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills in the context of web design and has also taught me much about user experience and design.</p>
            <p>In college, I decided to study Computer Science, Maths, and Chemistry. I find that these subjects scratch a similar itch that coding and developing software does, but with less creativity, which, while satisfying and enjoyable, can’t touch la crème de la crème. Aside from Computer Science, these subjects, in particular, have worked to build my problem-solving skills and analytical thinking, and when I say that, I mean it. They feed nicely into each other with all subjects revolving around those fundamental skills.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I spend much of my free time on LeetCode or working on projects with my friends in our Git and GitHub-based coding collective, Precision Coding, which has taught me to collaborate, effectively communicate, and also the basics of version control. I play the piano, go to the gym, and go hiking/backpacking on my weeks off. In particular, going to the gym taught me that my actions affect my reality, which I think is the most important lesson I have learned in my life so far and why these hobbies have contributed so significantly to my schoolwork and my education, allowing me to revise when I don’t want to and to put in the work when I don’t want to. Additionally, these hobbies “heal the soul,” so to speak, allowing me to work harder and be happier in general. What’s more, balancing these tasks throughout the years has made my time management skills substantially better and has allowed me to more effectively organize tasks throughout the day. I am currently completing the DofE Gold expedition award this summer and, as previously mentioned, I like to hike and backpack when I can, In doing these, I have learned a lot, mostly how to read a map but also the importance of continued effort and the efficacy of “one foot after the other.”</p>
            <p>Learning about computer science, mathematics, and chemistry so far has been an immensely rewarding and changing experience. Software development and coding in particular has driven me to continuously improve myself, my ideas and innovate. Between them projects, studying and my hobbies have equipped me with skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication and made me resilient, disciplined, and improved my ability to learn. I am looking forward to developing my skills, creating things, and learning more going forward.</p>
